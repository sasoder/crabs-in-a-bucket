**Mini Game Design Document: Just Dig**

**1. Concept:**
A 2D tilemap roguelike platformer where the player digs downwards by jumping, breaking blocks directly below. The goal is to descend as deep as possible through procedurally generated levels filled with enemies and hazards. Every 10 rows cleared, the player enters a shop to spend coins on permanent Relics and single-use Consumables. The run ends upon losing all 3 lives (permadeath).

**2. Core Mechanics:**

*   **Movement:** Standard left/right horizontal movement on surfaces.
*   **Jumping / Digging:**
    *   Pressing the jump button initiates an upward leap *and* simultaneously destroys blocks in the row directly beneath the player's position *at the start of the jump*.
    *   **Base Dig Area:** 1 block wide x 1 block deep. This can be upgraded via Relics.
    *   Enemies within/on the destroyed block area are instantly killed.
*   **Progression:**
    *   The game world scrolls vertically as the player descends.
    *   Depth is measured in "rows" or equivalent units.
    *   Every 10 rows descended, the game pauses, and the Shop interface appears.
*   **Lives & Permadeath:**
    *   The player starts with 3 lives (hearts).
    *   Taking damage (e.g., enemy collision, environmental hazards) removes one life.
    *   Losing all lives ends the run (permadeath). The score is the maximum depth reached.
*   **Economy:**
    *   **Currency:** Coins.
    *   **Sources:**
        *   Killing enemies (only Stomp Kill, dig kill only kills).
        *   Picking up coin items randomly scattered in the environment.
        *   Specific Relic effects (e.g., Excavator's Greed, Piggy Bank Shard).
        *   Using specific Consumables (e.g., Geode).

**3. Shop System:**

*   **Trigger:** Appears automatically every 10 rows descended.
*   **Interface:** A pop-up window displaying a selection of items (e.g., 2-3 Relics and 2-3 Consumables) with their respective coin costs.
*   **Purchasing:** Players spend collected coins to acquire items. Once purchased, Relics are immediately active, and Consumables are added to the player's inventory, HOWEVER, the player can only ever carry 3 consumables, and they are in order with one key as the use trigger. You can reorder them in the shop, and sell them whenever.
